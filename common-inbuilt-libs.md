#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python script that lists all files and directories in the current directory.
2. Create a Python script that checks if a directory exists, and if not, creates it.
3. Write a Python script that changes the current working directory to a specified directory and prints its path.
4. Create a program that deletes all `.txt` files from a directory.

### **2. `sys`**
The `sys` module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It allows you to manipulate the Python runtime environment, interact with command-line arguments, and control the interpreter.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Command-line argument handling.
- Exiting the program.
- Interacting with the Python runtime environment.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python script that takes a filename as a command-line argument and prints its content.
2. Write a program that prints the current Python version using the `sys` module.
3. Create a program that accepts multiple command-line arguments and prints their sum.
4. Implement a script that exits if the user inputs a specific word.

### **3. `math`**
The `math` module provides mathematical functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and factorials.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Trigonometric functions.
- Logarithmic and exponential functions.
- Factorial and square root.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number using the `math` module.
2. Implement a program that calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent of a given angle.
3. Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using `math.gcd()`.
4. Write a Python script that takes a number as input and prints its square root and logarithm.

### **4. `random`**
The `random` module provides functions to generate random numbers and selections, which are useful for simulations, games, and testing.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Generating random numbers.
- Shuffling sequences.
- Selecting random elements from a list.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python script that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Create a function that shuffles a list of numbers using `random.shuffle()`.
3. Write a script that simulates rolling a die 10 times and prints the results.
4. Implement a program that picks a random item from a list of strings.

### **5. `datetime`**
The `datetime` module allows you to manipulate dates and times, calculate time differences, and format dates and times.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Working with dates and times.
- Formatting date/time strings.
- Calculating time intervals.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python program that prints the current date and time.
2. Create a function that takes a date in string format (e.g., `2024-09-05`) and converts it to a `datetime` object.
3. Write a program that calculates how many days are left until a given future date (e.g., New Year's).
4. Implement a program that formats the current date in different formats (e.g., `DD/MM/YYYY`, `MM-DD-YYYY`).

---

### **6. `json`**
The `json` module allows you to work with JSON data, converting between Python dictionaries and JSON format.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Reading and writing JSON data.
- Parsing JSON strings.
- Converting Python objects to JSON and vice versa.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python script that reads a JSON file and prints its contents.
2. Implement a function that converts a Python dictionary into a JSON string.
3. Write a program that reads a list of users from a JSON file and prints their names.
4. Create a Python script that writes some sample data (e.g., a list of dictionaries) into a JSON file.

---

### **7. `re`**
The `re` module provides support for working with regular expressions in Python.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Finding patterns in text.
- Replacing patterns.
- Validating string formats (e.g., emails, phone numbers).

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python program that checks if a string contains only letters using a regular expression.
2. Create a function that extracts all email addresses from a given text.
3. Write a script that replaces all whitespace characters in a string with underscores using `re.sub()`.
4. Implement a program that validates whether a string is a properly formatted phone number (e.g., `123-456-7890`).

---

### **8. `collections`**
The `collections` module provides specialized container datatypes like named tuples, ordered dictionaries, and default dictionaries.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Counting occurrences of elements using `Counter`.
- Working with ordered dictionaries using `OrderedDict`.
- Using `defaultdict` to handle missing keys in dictionaries.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python program that counts the frequency of each character in a string using `collections.Counter`.
2. Create a program that creates a `defaultdict` where missing keys are automatically assigned a default value of `0`.
3. Write a Python script that stores and prints student names and grades using `collections.namedtuple`.
4. Implement a function that sorts a dictionary based on its values using `OrderedDict`.

---

### **9. `itertools`**
The `itertools` module provides functions to work with iterators efficiently.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Creating combinations and permutations.
- Infinite iterators.
- Grouping elements.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python function that generates all possible combinations of a list of numbers.
2. Create a script that uses `itertools.cycle()` to iterate through a list infinitely.
3. Write a function that takes a list and prints all possible permutations of its elements.
4. Use `itertools.groupby()` to group consecutive elements of a list that are the same.

---

### **10. `subprocess`**
The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and retrieve their return codes.

#### **Common Uses:**
- Running shell commands.
- Working with external processes.
- Capturing command output.

#### **Practice Exercises:**
1. Write a Python script that runs the `ls` command (or `dir` on Windows) and prints the output.
2. Implement a function that runs a command-line program and returns its output.
3. Create a program that runs a shell command to create a new directory using `subprocess`.
4. Write a Python script that executes a ping command to check network connectivity.
